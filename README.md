Fluid Sorting Gadgets is a mod that was originally made to combat an issue with Modern Industrialization where the fluid hatch had 1 input and 2 outputs but was only accessible from one side, within the pack I could not find a way of sorting the fluids out so decided to make it myself, and from there a few other cool fluid-related gadgets where born

![The 1in2out fluid pipe system](https://i.ibb.co/PNwgvGs/image-2023-07-22-144310907.png)

The "1in2out" pipe system is a single block that takes an input from the top (for the nuclear hatch, this is water) and then outputs that fluid into the first fluid slot in the block below it, it then extracts the other 2 fluids and puts them in tanks to the east and west.

it should work with any combination of fluids as long as the block below has at least 3 fluid slots, can accept the fluid above, and can extract the fluid to the east and west

The infinite water tank does exactly what it says, you can extract an infinite amount of water from it, either using any mods pipes or with a bucket.

The general tank stores 27 (the same as a chest) of most liquids, if you interact with it, it will tell you how many buckets are stored within it, it should work like any tank, most of the time.


# future plans
I have considered a block that automatically fills all fluid holding devices in the area with a given fluid (a bit like the old Everfull Urn from Thaumcraft) and also a more configurable sorting block that can deal with multiple directions, however right now this mod is here to deal with a niche-ish problem so I'm not sure when these plan will have action taken on them.
